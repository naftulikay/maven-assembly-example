maven-assembly-example
======================

    Version: ${project.version}

A nifty little project which demonstrates the awesomeness of the Maven Assembly
Plugin. This project creates a really cool runnable distribution in tar.gz
and ZIP file formats including all dependencies, configuration files, and 
scripts to run the example application. 

Imagine the possibilities!
